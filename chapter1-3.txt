1.3 A Matlab Program with a Library Function
Imagine you stand on a distance, say 10 m away, watching someone throwing a ball upwards.
A straight line from you to the ball will then make an angle with the horizontal that increases and decreases as the ball goes up and down.
Let us consider the ball at a particular moment in time, at which it has a height of 10 m.
What is the angle of the line then?
Again, this could easily be done with a calculator, but we continue to address gentle mathematical problems when learning to program.
Before thinking of writing a program, one should always formulate the algorithm, i.e, the recipe for what kind of calculations that must ne performed.
Here, if the ball is x m away and y m up in the air, it makes an angle theta with the ground, where tan theta = y/x.
The angle is then tan^-1(y/x).
Let us make a Matlab program for doing these calculations.
We introduce names x and y for the position data x and y, and the descriptive name angle for the angle theta.
The program is stored in a file ball_angle.m^

x = 10;  % Horizontal position
y = 10;  % Vertical position

angle = atan(y/x);
(angle/pi)*180  % Computes and prints to screen

Before we turn our attention to the running of this program, let us take a loko at one new thing in the code.
The line angle = atan(y/x), illustrates how the function atan, corresponding to tan-1 in mathematics ,is called with the ration y/x as input parameter or argument.
The atan function takes one argumetn, and the computed value is returned fron atan.
This means that were we see atan(y/x), a computation is performed (tan-1 (y/x))and the result "replaces" the text atan (y/x).
This is actually no more magic than if we have written just y/x:
then the computation of y/x would take place, and the result of that division would replace the text y/x.
Thereafter, the result is assigned to the name angle on the left-hand side of =.
Note that the trigonometric funstions, such as atan, work with angles in radians.
The return value of atan must hence be converted to degrees, and that is why we perform the computation (angle/pi)*180.
With the missing semi-colon, Matlab will do the computations and print the result to the screen.
And yes, the famous pi (pi) is a variable that is known to Matlab.
